How to Use the Site
1. Manage Flights

4. Manage Bookings
Visit the Booking Management page to see a list of all saved bookings, including flight details, passenger count, and a destination image.

Technical Aspects
1. Local Storage
We use localStorage to save flight and booking data, ensuring it persists across sessions. Example:


const bookings = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("bookings")) || [];
bookings.push({
    flight: selectedFlight,
    passengers: passengerDetails
});
localStorage.setItem("bookings", JSON.stringify(bookings));
        
2. Dynamic Content Rendering
Flights and bookings are displayed dynamically using JavaScript. Example:


function renderFlights(flights) {
    const tableBody = document.getElementById("flightTable").getElementsByTagName("tbody")[0];
    tableBody.innerHTML = "";
    flights.forEach(flight => {
        const row = document.createElement("tr");
        row.innerHTML = `
            ${flight.flightNo}
            ${flight.origin}
            ${flight.destination}
            ${flight.boardingDate}
            ${flight.boardingTime}
            ${flight.arrivalDate}
            ${flight.arrivalTime}
            ${flight.numberOfSeats}
            Book
        `;
        tableBody.appendChild(row);
    });
}
        
3. Dynamic Forms
Passenger forms dynamically generate input fields based on the number of passengers entered. Example:


function generatePassengerFields() {
    const numPassengers = parseInt(document.getElementById("numPassengers").value, 10);
    const passengerFieldsDiv = document.getElementById("passengerFields");
    passengerFieldsDiv.innerHTML = "";
    for (let i = 1; i <= numPassengers; i++) {
        passengerFieldsDiv.innerHTML += `
            Passenger ${i} Name:
            

            Passenger ${i} Passport ID:
            

        `;
    }
}
        
4. Filtering
Flights can be filtered by origin and destination using JavaScriptâ€™s filter() method. Example:


function applyFilters() {
    const originFilter = document.getElementById("filterOrigin").value.trim().toLowerCase();
    const destinationFilter = document.getElementById("filterDestination").value.trim().toLowerCase();

    const filteredFlights = flights.filter(flight => {
        return (!originFilter || flight.origin.toLowerCase().includes(originFilter)) &&
               (!destinationFilter || flight.destination.toLowerCase().includes(destinationFilter));
    });

    renderFlights(filteredFlights);
}
